* Longterm goals:
  - Learn about electricity and circut design.
  - Learn how to prototype and implement circuts using paper as a medium.

* Class 1:
  * Goals:
      - Learn about the natural flow of electricity, and how we can direct it
        using circuits.
      - Get familiar with some of the components we will be using
        (LEDs, batteries).
  * Plan:
    - Introductions, names, etc
    - [[http://youtu.be/AI-6wMlaVTc][This video]] to introduce the long term goals of the class
    - Discuss the video, see what parts of the video the would like to emulate.
    * Introduce basic concepts involved in a circuit
      - power source
      - draw (LED)
      - polarity/flow of electricity
      - short circuit/open circuit
      - maybe a switch?

        - Should total at less than $3 per student to make a handful of
          throwies each, with and without switches.
      - The students should be able to take these home afterwards.
      - [[http://youtu.be/GAriT4B-gkA][This video]] shows some interesting uses
        for throwies, but also kinda encourages throwing them at random things.

* Class 2:
  * Goals:
    Get started with conductive ink, learn about electricity flow in various
    circut configurations.
  * Plan:
    * [[http://youtu.be/GarBZhZnFQs][This video]] to introduce conductive ink, explain it’s what was used to
      power the pop-up book shown in the first class.
    * Project: Simple LED Paper Circuit
      * Components:

        | Conductive Ink Pen | $10  |      |

        |--------------------+------+------|

      - Draw the single LED circuit from the first class on card (no connections
        yet, just hold the LED to the ink).
      * Discuss various ways to create a more permanent connection between the
        ink and the components.
        - soldering
        - cold solder with ink
        - copper tape
        - metal bits (croc head clips, paper clips, stripped wire)
        - non-conductive method
      - Permanently connect existing components in the circuit.
      * Extend the existing circuit with extra LEDs.
        - wiring components in series
        - wiring components in parallel
        - multi loop circuit layout
        - As a separate circuit feeding off the same source
      - Add in additional LEDs
      - We could possibly turn this into a really simple card project so they
        have something interesting to take home, but I would recommend giving
        them only 5 or so minutes to sketch a basic design beforehand and layout
        where they would like their leds, then saving all the coloring/serious
        arts and crafts until after all the circuitry is complete, as there’is a
        lot of material to work though. A card project could also be split,
        across two classes so that only only one LED is talked about in the
        first class, then a multi component circuits are introduced in the
        second class.

* Class 3:
  - Goals:
    - Now that we have learned about circuit design with only LEDs, we will
      begin introducing new components, specifically a sound microcontroller.
  - Plans:
    * Project:
